* Scoring and Prioritization
  Priority is given to the patient with the highest number of points, with points earned according to his diagnosis.
* Prioritization Dashboard
  In the dashboard, patients and their highest risk are seen, where you can use the filter and search for a name to get a specific patient name and a specific diagnosis.
  We can also make a report to get the percentage of all diagnoses and see the cases and deal with them.

* Integration with Existing Systems
  Our website is integrated in all aspects, serving all patients and cases, and is also capable of developing new features that help in diagnosis and other things.
* Reporting and Analytics
  In terms of reports and analyses, all patients appear with the summary and all important percentages for the patients as a whole.
  The report can be deleted and a new report can be created if other patients are added.

## Features:
* Customizable patient scorecards
  Where the main user (admin) can add, modify and delete patients, cases or diagnoses, and where he can give and modify the gain of points, where in short he is able to deal with the entire system and do what he wants
* Audit trails
  All modifications, additions and deletions of patients are also seen so that no patient information is lost and all new and old information is stored.
